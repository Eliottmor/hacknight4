# hacknight4 - TBD 

### Format

The hackathon will begin at `6:30`, following the `Iron Chef` format where a _secret ingredient_ is revealed and you the hackers incorporate it into... something? 
A web app, a algorithm, a mobile app, all three, etc. Whatever your mind comes up with. 

*But Basil, what is a secret ingredient?* Simple: anything. Historically it's been things like some hardware / device (VR), a API / technology (AWS Alexa), or any other 
technology-related "thing". The only common thread is it's got to be immediately accessible to everyone equally (and free to hack at). 

*But I wanted to do XYZ instead!* Great, do it! If you build something awesome and totally unrelated, you *might* still win. But even better, _bake_ that secret ingredient in
to your solution and win on both fronts! 

- `5:30 - 6:15`: Introduction, food, team organization, Wifi, etc
- `6:15 - 6:30`: Secret Ingredient Revealed
- `6:30 - 9:00`: Hack! Welcome to come and go as you please, but if you'd like to submit for judging and prizes, make sure to demo and submit a PR on this repo! 
- `9:00 - Whenever`: Judgement, prizes, and all the glory
